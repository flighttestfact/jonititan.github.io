I was very fortunate recently to win an [RSE Cloud Computing Fellowship](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-11-14-congratulations-new-rse-cloud-computing-fellows).  There are many things now to do to make this a success and I hope to be as open as possible so that the work can have the greatest possible impact.
It is my particular hope to work closely with the [Dronecode Foundation](https://www.dronecode.org/) to make it easier for fellow researchers to connect their drones into an architecture that will best serve them in automating their experiment workflows and making sure their aircraft are used to their full effectiveness.
