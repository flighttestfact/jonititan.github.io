I was quite sad to hear last week that Hybrid Air Vehicles will be leaving Shed 1.[ITV News article](https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/update/2017-09-12/worlds-largest-airship-to-get-a-new-home/)  This was perhaps inevitable given the small airfield available.

I am very curious where they will end up and while I hope it will be Cranfield we shall have to wait and see.
There are big things afoot at Cranfield and the digital aviation initiative is especially exciting.[Cranfield DARTEC](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/press/news-2017/new-centre-to-spearhead-uk-research-in-digital-aviation-technology)

Combined with [MUEAVI](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/press/news-2017/cranfield-university-wins-funding-to-test-and-validate-autonomous-vehicle-on-campus) Cranfield will be quite the hub for innovation in autonomy and advanced systems. :-)

I hope to be able to share some of the new ideas here as we progress.
